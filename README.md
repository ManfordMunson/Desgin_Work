# Desgin_Work
For all code senior design related.

# Camera
The responsibility of the camera is to be able to track one of three primary colors. Using the camera we want to be able to path to the ball by communicating with an Arduino to run the motors to the location of the ball. A stretch goal would be having the robot return to the initial position through use of the camera.

# DC Motors
The motors will be controlled by use of an Arduino that will send a voltage to the motors to tell them to drive when the RaspberryPi communicates that it is time to do so.

# Steppers
Using a stepper motor we would like to control a garage door type of collection mechanism, to do this we would connect the stepper to the Arduino.

# Notes
All code regarding RaspberryPi should be Python and all code from Arduino should be C++.
